# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Name: StudyMate - Smart Study Organizer

## 1. Overview

StudyMate is a web-based platform that helps users store, organize, and access essential study materials, including commands, URLs, YouTube videos, and notes, in one place. The system is optimized for storage efficiency, leveraging external APIs for media storage while maintaining fast performance.

## 2. Objectives

- Provide a structured way to organize study resources.
- Optimize storage by using MongoDB Atlas (500 MB free tier) efficiently.
- Support Google Drive and YouTube API integrations for external file and video storage.
- Enable fast search and filtering of stored resources.
- Ensure accessibility across devices (mobile & desktop).

## 3. Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (SEO-friendly, API support)
- **Backend:** Express.js (Node.js) with MongoDB Atlas
- **Storage:**
  - MongoDB Atlas: Store metadata (titles, descriptions, tags)
  - Google Drive API: Store large files externally
  - YouTube Embeds: Save video URLs
  - Cloudinary: Store images (if needed)
- **Authentication:** Firebase Auth (Google Login)
- **Deployment:**
  - Vercel (Frontend)
  - Render (Backend API)

## 4. Features

### 4.1 Core Features

- **User Authentication:** Google Login via Firebase.
- **Resource Management:** Add, edit, and delete study materials.
- **Categorization:** Organize by topics (e.g., AI, Programming, Cybersecurity).
- **Search & Filters:** Quick retrieval of materials.
- **Bookmarks:** Save important links, YouTube videos, and documents.
- **Notes:** Write and save notes in Markdown format.
- **Responsive UI:** Mobile and desktop compatibility.

### 4.2 Advanced Features (Future Scope)

- **AI-Powered Recommendations:** Suggest resources based on study patterns.
- **Collaborative Features:** Allow shared study groups.
- **Export/Import:** Enable users to backup or transfer their data.

## 5. API Integrations

- **Google Drive API**: File storage.
- **YouTube API**: Fetch video metadata and embed videos.
- **Cloudinary API**: Store images if required.

## 6. System Constraints

- MongoDB Atlas 500 MB storage limit.
- No media file storage in MongoDB (only metadata).
- Third-party API rate limits.

## 7. AI Prompt for Content Automation

```text
You are an AI-powered content assistant for a study management website called StudyMate. Your task is to generate well-structured and categorized summaries of educational content provided by the user. The summaries should:
- Extract key points from long texts.
- Automatically categorize resources based on subjects.
- Provide metadata such as estimated reading time, difficulty level, and suggested related topics.
- Format responses in Markdown for easy saving and sharing.
Output should be concise and well-organized.
```

## 8. Deployment Plan

- **Phase 1:** Core feature development (User Authentication, CRUD operations, Categorization, Search & Filters, UI design).
- **Phase 2:** API integrations (Google Drive, YouTube, Cloudinary).
- **Phase 3:** Optimizations and enhancements (AI-based recommendations, collaborative features).

## 9. Success Metrics

- Number of active users.
- Storage efficiency (keeping usage below 500MB MongoDB limit).
- Response time for search queries (<500ms).
- User engagement (average session duration, returning users).
